# Code Institute Stream 2 Band Project

#### Technologies used

###### HTML
I tried to use as much semantic HTML5 as possible. I didn't want to stuff the site with it if it wasn't needed. 

###### CSS
I used bootstrap as the css framework for the app. I also applied custom styles of my own. 

###### JavaScript
Javascript gives the app a lot of the functionality to the app. 

####### dc.js
####### d3.js
####### crossfilter.js
####### crossfilter.js
####### queue.js
An asynchronous helper library, it waits until all data is avaiable before passing

####### intro.js
intro.js is used to provide a step-by-step guide to user on how to use the app and what each section is for. 

###### Flask

###### MongoDB
